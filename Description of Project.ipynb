    "When you visit a new city, you usually explore the most famous attractions and sightseeings. But when it comes to eat or have a drink to relax , you probably have no idea where to go to. This project will help to discover neighborhoods in cities based on a person's preferences of a neighborhood he has already visited. In the project we will use data of neighborhoods from New York, Toronto, Paris and London.\n",
